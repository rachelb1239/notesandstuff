# Redux Intellectual Debt Grows - 07/29/19
## Today I learned...
- React/Redux: Built out functionality for a variable rating scale for products (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 5, how does this shoe fit?)
- Seperation of Concerns: Had an aha moment about pulling functions out of files that render my components so they can be reused and to keep code cleaner
- Testing: Leveled up my test game with jest
  - Learned to test deep equality for objects
  - Since I seperated my functions out into another file they were much easier to test individually

## Things I'd still like to figure out
### 1. A better way to pull out only the properties I need from state
I was able to pull out a single property from an object in the store (yay destructuring). We shall call him PropA. 
PropA was an object of key value pairs, where the keys needed to be rendered as items in a list.
PropA had the dispatch function added on as another key value pair. 
I could no longer just map the keys of PropA to a list because PropA had been tainted with the dispatch property.
I did not have time to find an elegant solution to this so I return to mapping the entirety of the state to props

My thoughts are that I need to assign PropA to a property within an object { PropA: PropA } and return that object instead of return PropA
directly. That way dispatch gets attached to the parent object and I can pull out PropA from the wrapper object.

### 2. Implementing the Redux Selector Pattern
Seems like a good way to keep data manipulation outside of the component file
