# Setup w/ team: 
- React using Create React App
    - This helped with webpack, sass, and lint config; still needed a few modifications
    - Eliminated need for hosting client files w/ express, pre-configured for dev local hosting
- Redux
    - Initial config of store, test reducers
- CircleCI
    - Used docker for environment
    - Setup caching for dependencies, siginificantly reduced time to setup and run tests (~4min to less than a minute)
- ESLint w/ AirBnB Style Guide
    - Very strict, easy to get caught up in trying to prevent errors as you type w/ VS Code extension
- Testing w/ Jest and Enzyme
    - Required Eslint env config to prevent 'test' from being undefined error
    - Enzyme has boilerplate code for 'config' that looks like it needs to put in a seperate file or otherwise included in all test files

# Notable Challenges
## NPM Module Version Conflict
- NPM modules installed globally (or maybe just a  higher level directory?) can conflict with project modules
- Received error messages when attempting to run linter stating eslint was outdated even though we had the correct version dependency in package.json file and had run npm install
- Removing node module from higher level directory entirely fixed the problem after attempting to update didn't seem to work

## CircleCI Config
- .circleci folder needs to be in same level as the rest of the project
