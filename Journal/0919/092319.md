# Measure Performance with New Relic 09/23/19

## Overview
Today I am setting up new relic to test the performance of my queries.
Install seems relatively simple. npm install package, add line to require new relic in main app, copy config file and insert license. Start server!

Issue a get request using postman, I see the request go through locally, but I don't see anything on new-relic dashboard.

Enabled server-side configuration in newrelic. I can't turn it back off to see if this is what fixed the problem, but new relic is now registering requests made on my local machine in the dashboard.

get /reviews/:productid/meta

1. No Optimization
- Takes ~ 22,000 miliseconds
2. CREATE INDEX ON review (product_id)
- Takes ~ 1,420 miliseconds
3. CREATE INDEX ON reviews_photos (review_id);
- Takes ~ 1,290 ms
4. CREATE INDEX ON characteristics_review (review_id);
- Takes ~ 51 ms!
5. CREATE INDEX ON characteristics_review (characteristic_id);
- Takes ~ 21 ms!!!!!

GET /reviews/:product_id/list
1. No further optimization
- Takes ~41 ms
- Appears that the post processing algorithm to format the json to return to the client is slowing down the response more than the actual query
- Request is under 50 ms, but I would like to come back to rewriting my post processing logic if I have time
