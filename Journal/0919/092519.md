## Overview
Need to get my data generation scripts and my schema file onto my ec2 instance

 - Installed git, didn't take the time to setup ssh keys, just cloned repo over https
 - Installed node
 - Was able to run npm install and then generate my first file

 - Got through 3/4 files, used up all the CPU(?) or memory and process terminated on 3rd file. Command line just said 'Killed'

 - Altered my data file generation scripts to break up the writes into multiple files
 - I still have a bottle neck with the write command. The write stream doesn't seem to exit or buffer doesn't clear until all the files are written even though I have a command to end the write stream and start a new one.
 - Spent some time being intimate with VIM to repeatedly alter my code on the EC2 instance to see how many lines I could add to my file without either maxing the CPU or running out of memory on the EC2 instance (50,000 100,000, 10,000). Ended up only being able to write 500,000 records for reviews across 5 files, but still able to write 10,000,000 records for all my other tables.
 - All the records were able to be imported into my database using my schema script!!
 - Gave up trying to alter my code, but I was still curions
 - After probably too much time searching... !!!! NEED TO WAIT FOR DRAIN EVENT BEFORE WRITING TO THE FILE AGAIN!!!
