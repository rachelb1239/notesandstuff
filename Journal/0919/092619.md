# Deployment to AWS Part 2
09/26/19

## Overview
- Add a role to postgres with a password before trying to expose the connection to world
- Setup client on other EC2 instance
- Configure the Postgres pool file to connect to the IP of the EC2 and use correct password

## Postgres User Authenication
- Created a user with a password on postgres. 
- When I try to access the db locally with the user I don't get prompted for a password or denied access without a password.
- Dropped and readded the user several times. Still allowed to login without password. 
- I finally realized I setup the postgres hba file to trust all local connections so it required password authentication locally.
