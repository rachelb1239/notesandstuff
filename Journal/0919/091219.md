# Postgres Continued... Plus creating files!

## Script to autogenerate my database
- Seriously the best decision so far of this project
- Made a script file to drop my database, recreate it, connect to new database, create tables, and populate the database with my CSV files
- Not sure about roles, probably not super smart to continue to use root user and I may run into permissions issues later

```
psql databasenamehere -f nameoffilerelativetocurrentpathhere
```

## Making Files
- Used node fs to auto generate some files
- Used faker library to auto generate some fake test
- Managed to create a file with 10,000,000 records

Pro tip: batch your write operations. I tried to write every individual record and my computer ran out of memory.
